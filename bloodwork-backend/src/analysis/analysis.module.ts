/**
 * Analysis Module - NestJS module configuration for AI analysis functionality
 * 
 * WHY: This module is the heart of your background processing system.
 * It orchestrates the entire AI analysis pipeline from job creation
 * through background processing to result generation.
 * 
 * FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Manages analysis job lifecycle and status tracking
 * - Configures Bull queue for background AI processing
 * - Integrates with uploads for file access
 * - Integrates with results for final data storage
 * - Provides real-time job status for React Native polling
 * 
 * RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR APP:
 * React Native "Analyze" button -> AnalysisController -> AnalysisService
 * Background queue -> AnalysisProcessor -> AI simulation -> ResultsService
 * React Native polling -> AnalysisController -> Real-time status updates
