/**
 * Upload Response - Contract for file upload response
 * 
 * WHY: This response ensures your React Native app receives exactly the data
 * it expects from the upload endpoint. It matches the UploadResponse interface
 * in your frontend types/types.ts file.
 * 
 * FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Defines the structure of POST /uploads response
 * - Provides uploadId for subsequent analysis request
 * - Includes fileUrl for potential file access
 * - Enables API documentation with Swagger
 * 
 * RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR APP:
 * Your uploadPdf API function expects this exact response format
 * UploadCard component uses uploadId to trigger analysis
 * 
 * NAMING CONVENTION:
 * - This is output data (response to user) â†’ "Response" suffix
 * - Input data (from user) uses "Dto" suffix
